## üöÄ Overview

**TragerX** combines **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**, **A* Pathfinding**, and **robotic workflows** to create a dynamic environment for robotic navigation and task automation. This project simulates robots navigating through a grid-based map, detecting obstacles, planning paths, and interacting with customers or counters using QR codes and OTP verification.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Grid-Based SLAM**: Simulates a robot's ability to explore unknown environments and map obstacles dynamically.
- **A* Pathfinding Algorithm**: Implements efficient path planning for robots to navigate from source to destination.
- **Multi-Robot System**: Includes stationary and mobile robots with unique IDs and workflow states.
- **QR Code Scanning & OTP Verification**: Simulates customer interaction via QR code scanning and OTP validation.
- **Dynamic Obstacle Detection**: Robots detect obstacles in real-time using simulated ultrasonic sensors.
- **User Interface**: Visualize the robot's path, map updates, counters, and customer interactions using Pygame.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

The project leverages the following technologies:

- **Python 3.11**
- **Pygame**: For visualization and simulation.
- **OpenCV**: For QR code scanning.
- **A* Algorithm**: For efficient pathfinding.
- **Tkinter**: For OTP verification GUI.
- **Numpy**: For grid-based calculations.

## üîÑ Project Workflow

1. The simulation starts with a welcome intro screen.
2. A mobile robot navigates from the charging station (source) to a customer location using A* pathfinding.
3. At the customer location:
   - The robot scans a QR code to determine the next counter destination.
   - The user verifies their identity using an OTP system.
4. The robot navigates to the assigned counter, waits for service, then returns to the charging station.

### Robot States:
- `Idle`: Waiting at the source or counter.
- `To Customer`: Navigating to the customer location.
- `At Customer`: Ready for QR scan and OTP verification.
- `To Counter`: Navigating to the assigned counter.
- `At Counter`: Waiting for service at the counter.
